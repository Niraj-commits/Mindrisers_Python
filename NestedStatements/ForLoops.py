# Iterable Data : Data that can be iterated like (List,Tuple,Set,Dictionary,String)

# Iteration: Loop Process of going from start to end of the iterable data [1,2,3,4,5]

# Iterator : variable that is used for iteration of iterable data

iterable_data = ["niraj","karki",1,[1,2,"striii"]] #Group Data

for iterator in iterable_data: #iterator = Assumed Variable
